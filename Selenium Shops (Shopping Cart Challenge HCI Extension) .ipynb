    "# Answer to Q3 (Dictionary vs. Hash Table vs. List Tuple For Cognition) \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why we use a dictionary as compared to the hash table or list tuple is mainly for ability to make immutable cognition processes, or in other words, once something has been confirmed, we cannot take it back. In addition, the dictionary <key,value> property in Python allows us to quickly verify if a particular item has been misplaced by a pricing, or vice a versa. Each key in a dictionary can only be paired with one unique value, which makes the dictionary as a data structure immutable without re-writing the values to the array, much like the register and receipt in a real world shopping scenario. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we had to use a hash table, we would have to know what was the hashing value of the key to the value (as in a cryptographic fashion), and for a real-life shopping application, that would simply be impractical. Also, for the list tuple, we can only hold a finite amount of items and that it would be very unrealistic to know exactly what index the item was put into, let alone the key and value. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, in summary, the dictionary is preferable for cognition and information processes for HCI applications, such as this Selenium Shops Python Application, for the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Runtime:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary: <key,value> search: O(1) \n",
    "\n",
    "Hash Table: O(1) without hash, O(n) with hash \n",
    "\n",
    "List Tuple: O(n^2) with full list, O(n) if just linear search \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practicality: \n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary: Can be practical, \"human friendly\", similar to that of a human interaction between checking the item names and matching them with item prices on a real shopping list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hash Table: Not practical for cryptographic reasons, not every hash can be to each item in the table, and linear collision would mean the non CS equivalent of having duplicate items. Selenium Shops, which mirrors a big outlet retailer like Macys, Premium Outlets, seldom make that type of mistake, or the cashier would be fired. \n",
    "\n",
    "List Tuple: Simply too much to memorize in a system, a key and value pair to each index of the tuple. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Usability: \n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary: Usable for any finite number of items, even if the receipt had missing items (a real life possibility,\n",
    "considering human error in checkouts).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hash Table: Useful until duplicate items or missing items occur. \n",
    "\n",
